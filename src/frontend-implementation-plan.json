        "The logo image height values are reduced by ~20% for both base and md breakpoints (currently h-[200px] and md:h-[240px]) so the logo remains visually balanced within the smaller header.",
        "On mobile and desktop, the header remains fixed, navigation buttons remain visible and clickable, and the mobile menu open/close behavior still works.",
        "Clicking navigation items still scrolls to the correct section with appropriate offset (no section titles hidden behind the header)."
