    "Use responsive hamburger navigation on mobile with touch targets >= 44x44px.",
    "Optimize images (including lazy loading) and prioritize fast page load speed.",

    "Use SEO-friendly HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy and placeholder text content.",
    "Support user-provided brand assets (logo + hero image) with responsive sizing/cropping and optimized delivery (proper formats, compression, and lazy loading where appropriate).",
    "Logo should be scaled to 5× its current rendered size consistently across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.",
    "For custom domain connection, publish domain verification file at public/.well-known/ic-domains (no extension) with one domain per line (myplaceatqueretaro.com and www.myplaceatqueretaro.com).",

    "Contact form submissions should be handled via Formspree (https://formspree.io/f/xkgelwgw) instead of the Motoko backend; keep the same fields (name, email, phone, message) and use Formspree’s default success/error behavior."
