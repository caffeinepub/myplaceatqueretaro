# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the hero section tagline sentence render in white text without affecting any other styling or other occurrences of the same sentence elsewhere.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the hero section component so the sentence “Experience exceptional accommodations and real estate services in one of Mexico's most beautiful colonial cities” uses white text color.
- Scope the styling change to the hero section only, without modifying other hero styles or other sections.

**User-visible outcome:** On the landing page, the specified hero tagline sentence appears in white text, with no other visual changes on the page.
