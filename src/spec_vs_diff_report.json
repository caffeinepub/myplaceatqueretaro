However, the diff also includes unrelated metadata/documentation changes (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) that were not requested, violating the constraint to keep the change limited to header sizing.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly constrains changes to header sizing and lists non-goals such as not changing unrelated sections. The diff shows modifications to a summary file containing descriptions of many unrelated features.",
